Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena[1] and third-person hero shooter[2] video game developed and published by Finnish video game company Supercell.[3] The game was released worldwide on 12 December 2018, on iOS and Android platforms. The game features a variety of game modes, each with a distinctive objective. Players are able to choose from a large selection of unlockable characters, called "Brawlers", whom each have different abilities and playstyles.[4][5]

Setting
Brawl Stars takes place in a fictional abandoned amusement park named Starr Park. Initially introduced in a live-action short film,[6] in-game surveillance footage showed that Starr Park closed in 1995 due to magic purple gems that granted several staff and visitors in Starr Park immortality, but in the ensuing chaos, gave life to inanimate objects and mutated plant life and animals[7]

Gameplay

In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between different Brawlers, who can be unlocked through the Starr Road or purchased through the Shop to use in battles.[8] In December 2022, a new progressive unlock system called the "Starr Road" replaced Boxes as the main method to unlock Brawlers.[9] The cost to unlock each Brawler on the Starr Road depends on its rarity.[10]

During a match, players can use their Brawler's normal attack or their Super, a special attack that charges up through damaging opponents or in some cases through additional means. Players can also equip their Brawlers with power-ups known as Gadgets, Star Powers, Gears, and Hypercharges; Gadgets and Hypercharges can be activated during a match, while Star Powers and Gears are passive abilities.

Game Modes
Brawl Stars has a variety of different game modes that players can choose from, each having a different objective and maps. Players can invite friends to play with them up to the maximum team size of a game mode. Most modes involve two teams with three players each, though select modes can involve either five or two players per team. [11][12]

Showdown: A battle royale-style game mode involving one (solo), two (duo), or three (trio) Brawlers per team. Ten (twelve in Trio Showdown) players battle for survival, with Power Cube boxes scattered across the map providing boosts to attack and health.
Brawl Ball: A soccer game mode where two teams of three (or 5 for Brawl Ball 5V5)Brawlers attempt to score points by shooting a ball into the opponents' goal. The game ends if one team scores two points, or if one team has a point advantage after two minutes. Basketball, volleyball, and ice hockey variants were added later.
Gem Grab: Gems spawn in the middle of the map, and two teams of three Brawlers must collect the highest number of Gems possible. A team wins if it is able to accumulate ten or more Gems for 15 seconds.
Wipeout and Bounty: Deathmatch game modes. In Wipeout, two teams of either three or five must defeat 10 or 20 enemy Brawlers. In Bounty, teams must earn 20 points by defeating Brawlers, who become worth more points for each kill, with a blue star deciding the draw from overtime.
Heist: Two teams of three Brawlers each attempt to destroy the opponents' highly durable safe located near their spawn point, before the enemy team can destroy their own safe.
Hot Zone: A king of the hill game mode. Two teams of three Brawlers each must stay in all Hot Zones for 100 seconds. The match ends if this requirement is met or one team had stayed in the Hot Zones longer than the other throughout the time limit. with a 2v2 version added later on in events
Knockout: A deathmatch game mode where players cannot respawn and rounds are won by defeating the entire enemy team. The first team to win two rounds wins the game. A variation with five Brawlers is unique in that each elimination causes the remaining teammates to gain extra damage and health.
Duels: A game mode involving two players playing against each other. Each player assembles a team of three Brawlers; after one of the players' Brawlers is defeated, the player plays the next. The goal is to defeat all three of the opponents' Brawlers. [13]
Ranked: In Ranked, a random 3v3 game mode and map are chosen with a chance for a modifier. Winning a game increases Points, and Point thresholds increase a player's rank. As a player breaks through certain Point thresholds, Ranked Starr Drops are obtained, which can give the player select cosmetic items. It was formerly called Power League.
Mega Pig: Players can join clubs or create them[14] to participate in Mega Pig, an event that occurs around once a month over a weekend. Each win adds to a club's points, which increases the Starr Drops they get at the end of the event.[15]with a mega Tree event during Christmas.
Map Maker: A mode where players can freely create maps and may apply custom modifiers to various modes in the game. Players can submit their maps into candidates of the day, allowing for a selection of random player-submitted maps to be played by other players, who can give the map a like or dislike, increasing or decreasing their chance of being selected. The map with the most likes becomes the winner of the day, which becomes available for everyone in a second Map Maker slot.[16]
